## Cable Operators Neutral Network Exchange for Community Transformation (CONNECT) 

Cable operator networks are a potentially powerful force that may be harnessed to narrow the digital divide in the Philippines, with their extensive service coverage and installed infrastructure. Unfortunately, cable operators lack sufficient technical skills to operate and maintain large-scale IP networks that deliver high-speed access to the Internet, and so they need to transform their workforce quickly and cost-efficiently. 

**CONNECT (Cable Operators Neutral Network Exchange for Community Transformation)** aims to achieve these goals by fostering cooperation and interconnectivity among cable TV operators
and providing technologies that would enable the delivery of competitive and new services.
This will be done by establishing an industry-initiated open and neutral Internet exchange point,
conducting intensive training, advocating the use of best practices and standards such as IPv6,
and harnessing new technologies such as software defined networking within the network and at
the exchange.

## Overview 

Cable network operators have to face and overcome several challenges in order to
significantly gain a bigger share of the local Internet market. Among these are:

1. There is a need to transform the existing infrastructure from one that supports the
delivery of (almost exclusively) video content, to one that is able to deliver triple-play
services and additional new services that will provide a competitive edge. Before any
such transformation in infrastructure and services may be made, there should be
requisite capability-building in terms of technology know-how to reengineer and
operate these flexible and forward-looking infrastructures
2. The cable industry needs to band together organizationally and physically interconnect
in order to achieve better purchasing leverage, economies of scale, and attain a critical
mass that puts it in a better position to compete with traditional large
telecommunications operators. From a technical perspective, interconnectivity and
domestic peering between local cable operators will ensure better domestic network
performance, more profitable use of expensive transit links, access and lower pricing
for higher-capacity international transit, and attractiveness for content providers to
colocate local content caches.
3. Even with the already-extensive legacy cable TV infrastructure, there are still
geographically large areas that remain digitally underserved. Covering these areas
would require large capital investments that would be difficult to recover due to poor
profitability. Despite the possibility of serving new areas by unlocking the latent
potential of cable TV providers, new access infrastructure approaches and business
models will have to be developed and applied in order to expand service coverage far
beyond the current geographic reach of legacy infrastructures.
Towards this end, we propose a multi-stakeholder, multi-pronged strategy that may be
described by the following: engagement, enhancement, exchange, enablement, and
empowerment.
