# Cable Operators Neutral Network Exchange for Community Transformation (CONNECT) 

Cable operator networks are a potentially powerful force that may be harnessed to narrow the digital divide in the Philippines, with their extensive service coverage and installed infrastructure. Unfortunately, cable operators lack sufficient technical skills to operate and maintain large-scale IP networks that deliver high-speed access to the Internet, and so they need to transform their workforce quickly and cost-efficiently. 

**CONNECT (Cable Operators Neutral Network Exchange for Community Transformation)** aims to achieve these goals by fostering cooperation and interconnectivity among cable TV operators
and providing technologies that would enable the delivery of competitive and new services.
This will be done by establishing an industry-initiated open and neutral Internet exchange point,
conducting intensive training, advocating the use of best practices and standards such as IPv6,
and harnessing new technologies such as software defined networking within the network and at
the exchange.

## Overview / Background

Cable television (CATV) operators enjoy a marginal share of the fixed broadband
Internet market in the country but their infrastructure assets cover distant and suburban areas that are generally out of reach by telecommunication companies. 

Cable network operators have to face and overcome several challenges in order to
significantly gain a bigger share of the local Internet market. Among these are:

1. There is a need to transform the existing infrastructure from one that supports the
delivery of (almost exclusively) video content, to one that is able to deliver triple-play
services and additional new services that will provide a competitive edge.

2. The cable industry needs to band together organizationally and physically interconnect
in order to achieve better purchasing leverage, economies of scale, and attain a critical
mass that puts it in a better position to compete with traditional large
telecommunications operators. 

3. Even with the already-extensive legacy cable TV infrastructure, there are still
geographically large areas that remain digitally underserved and covering these areas
would require large capital investments that would be difficult to recover due to poor
profitability. 

## Strategies and Objectives 

**Strategy 1: Engagement**. We believe that challenging problems like these require novel
multi-stakeholder approaches in order to find creative solutions and so, our aim is to engender a cooperative effort among the members of the cable industry, local R&D agencies and NREN operator, academe, local communities and government units. 

**Strategy 2: Enhancement**. We will embark on large-scale capability building between
and among project participants, and when feasible, the wider public by programming training and capacity-building activities that expose our target beneficiaries to the latest technologies and best practices in communication networks. 

**Strategy 3: Exchange**. We will be working towards the formation of an 
Internet exchange point targeted to, but not exclusively for, cable TV operators. This will ensure
good network performance particularly in the exchange of domestic traffic,
promote the development and distribution of local content, and create additional value for attracting foreign content-delivery networks to deploy caches. 

**Strategy 4: Enablement**. To ensure a flexible and future-proof infrastructure for cable TV
operators, we intend to employ networking components with software-defined networking (SDN) technology both in the
proposed cable operator IXP, and will promote the use of the same throughout partner cable TV
network infrastructures. 

**Strategy 5: Empowerment**. We will organize and pilot-test _CO-OWNs: Community Operated Wireless
Networks_, bottom-up community-driven infrastructure for developing reliable and flexible wireless access to the Internet.
